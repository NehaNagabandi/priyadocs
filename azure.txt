3 clould service model
software as a service (SaaS), 
infrastructure as a service (IaaS) (os installation,application)
platform as a service (PaaS) (just configure application)
What is IaaS PaaS and SaaS?
IAAS gives access to the resources like virtual machines and virtual storage.
(more control,more management)
PAAS give access to run time environment to deployment and development tools for application.
(less control,less management)
SAAS give access to the end user.
(readily avaliable application i.e offfice 365)


cloud types:

public cloud: owned by service providers and ,multiple org will use,based on vpn network

private cloud: own cloud i.e in their particular data centers(mainly for security)

hybrid cloud: combination of public and private 


Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)(cloud based identity for active services)

Any instance used by azure ,service (Resource)
Resource has one resource group and multiple regions,resources can be moved to diff res grps
res grp for(logical perspective)


cloud shell
(power shell,azure CLI(bash)) these 2 commands


commands:for powershell(case insensitive commands)

Get-AzContext(to know subscription ,where we are )
Get-AzSubscription(to know how many subscription are present)
set-azcontext -subscription "anothername where we need to change" (switch btw subscription)
get-azresourcegroup(list of resource groups)
get-azresource(list of resources running in subscription)
new-azresourcegroup -name abc -location centralus(to create resource group using power shell)
get-azresourcegroup -name res*(list of resorcegrp ,particular name starts with)
remove-azresourcegroup -name abc -force(by default it will delete)
get-azresourcegroup(here we can add particular name also) | remove-azresourcegroup (remove all resourcegroups)


:for bash i.e azure cli(case sensitive commands)

az account show(to which subscription that we are connected)
az account list(list of subscriptions)
az account set --subscription nameofsub(to change the subsc)

cidr(no of ip,range of ip)
network:(0 to 255)
network port cant be changed,host part is 0 until value is 255
ip= 2^(32-range of ip)
 

sub net:better management,improve performance,security

ipv4 vs ipv6(space for adress allotment)
virtual network: sub nets for ip adresses(without private ip we cannot deploy)

virtual machine: here virtual networks are connected

public ip adress creation:sku(stock keeping unit)(data access only from internet)
sku: STANDARD(high productivity and more secure) compared to BASIC
 

tcp and udp protocol

adding NSG to SUBNETS

peering(allowing trafic from one to other)


(after session timeout)netsh advfirewall set allprofiles state off

before vm creation: (vm is used for multiple systems and to save storage capacity)

network is created//for networks we are creating vm//

hostname(name of vm where we are)


spot instance:benifit for pay users i.e pay-as-you-go

disks:
hdd(poor performance)


web server connect command in vm usind rdp(install-windowsfeature web-server)
here we can paste our public ip to access the webserver

vm running:then charges will be  for {compute cost,disk cost,ip adress cost}
by stopping then cost for{disk , if ip is static then it will be charged}


publickey(for vm)

fault domain(A fault domain is a set of hardware components that share a single point of failure.)

and same data center but difference racks


scaleup/down(increasing capacity of instance)//vertical scaling
scaleout/in//horizontal

vm scale set:(horizontal) here instances will be automated based on usage

block blob (default ,cloud storage)
page(ex:disk)
append


sas (used to access blob)


container access(private)
by using obj url cant able to access,to acess ket generate sas url


--------->fileshare in windows vm to azure cloud using file share
(from vm to cloud (true)only one way of file share)


user acess(in active directory by adding user)
using azure active directory(AAD) we can authentic multiple applications

identity is an object
account is an identity of data center
tenant(AAD of your org account)

groups in AAD(security,office365)

delete of sync storage(have to unregister then delete)

first unregister(from register servers)
server end point


for backup & recovery:(recovery service vauts)
create retension wall
backup-->schedule,retention period


template deploy:
after vm creation ,there is template console here 



paas(web /app services readily available in azure)
iaas(vm in azure)

app service plan(physical allocation need)
web application is in app service

tls/ssl(for security layers )


azure vpn gateway(traffic flow through internet i.e onpremises to azure cloud)(ipsec/internet protocol security and ikeu2/internet key exchange u2)

express route(costly compared to vpn gateway)(this traffic will flow from private network,high speed)


metrics(it is not visible if you dont pin it to dashboard)






windows+r-mstsc

after adding disk in vm:in windows+r tab (diskmgmt.msc)
